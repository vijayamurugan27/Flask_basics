for web forms

pip install flsk-wtf

To handle the web forms in this application I'm going to use the Flask-WTF extension, 
which is a thin wrapper around the WTForms package that nicely integrates it with Flask.
This is the first Flask extension that I'm presenting to you, but it is not going to be
the last. Extensions are a very important part of the Flask ecosystem
